Benchmarking [1/2]: ./hyperfine_benching_in/poseidon.fut
ERROR: Hyperfine failed for './hyperfine_benching_in/poseidon.fut'.
ERROR: Hyperfine stderr: [31mError:[0m Command terminated with non-zero exit code 2 in the first warmup run. Use the '-i'/'--ignore-failure' option if you want to ignore this. Alternatively, use the '--show-output' option to debug what went wrong.
